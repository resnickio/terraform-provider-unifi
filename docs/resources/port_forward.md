# unifi_port_forward (Resource)

Manages a UniFi port forwarding rule.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Forward HTTPS traffic to a web server
resource "unifi_port_forward" "web_server" {
  name           = "Web Server HTTPS"
  enabled        = true
  protocol       = "tcp"
  dst_port       = "443"
  fwd_port       = "443"
  fwd_ip         = "10.0.100.50"
  pfwd_interface = "wan"
  log            = false
}

# Forward a range of game server ports
resource "unifi_port_forward" "game_server" {
  name           = "Game Server"
  enabled        = true
  protocol       = "udp"
  dst_port       = "27015-27020"
  fwd_port       = "27015-27020"
  fwd_ip         = "10.0.100.60"
  pfwd_interface = "wan"
}

# Port forward with source restriction
resource "unifi_port_forward" "ssh_restricted" {
  name           = "SSH (Restricted)"
  enabled        = true
  protocol       = "tcp"
  dst_port       = "22"
  fwd_port       = "22"
  fwd_ip         = "10.0.100.10"
  src            = "203.0.113.0/24"
  pfwd_interface = "wan"
  log            = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dst_port` (String) The destination port to forward from (external port).
- `fwd_ip` (String) The IP address to forward traffic to.
- `fwd_port` (String) The port to forward to on the destination host.
- `name` (String) The name of the port forward rule.
- `protocol` (String) The protocol for port forwarding. Valid values: 'tcp', 'udp', 'tcp_udp'.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the port forward rule is enabled. Defaults to true.
- `log` (Boolean) Whether to log forwarded traffic. Defaults to false.
- `pfwd_interface` (String) The WAN interface for the port forward. Valid values: 'wan', 'wan2', 'both'. Defaults to 'wan'.
- `src` (String) Restrict forwarding to traffic from this source IP/CIDR. Leave empty for any source.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the port forward rule.
- `site_id` (String) The site ID where the port forward rule is created.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
