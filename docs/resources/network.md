# unifi_network (Resource)

Manages a UniFi network/VLAN configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a VLAN network with DHCP
resource "unifi_network" "iot" {
  name         = "IoT Network"
  purpose      = "corporate"
  vlan_id      = 100
  subnet       = "10.0.100.1/24"
  dhcp_enabled = true
  dhcp_start   = "10.0.100.10"
  dhcp_stop    = "10.0.100.254"
  dhcp_dns     = ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
  domain_name  = "iot.local"
}

# Create a VLAN-only network (no routing/DHCP)
resource "unifi_network" "vlan_only" {
  name    = "External VLAN"
  purpose = "vlan-only"
  vlan_id = 200
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the network.
- `purpose` (String) The purpose of the network. Valid values: 'corporate', 'guest', 'wan', 'vlan-only'.

### Optional

- `dhcp_dns` (Set of String) Set of DNS servers to provide via DHCP (maximum 4). Must be valid IPv4 addresses.
- `dhcp_enabled` (Boolean) Whether DHCP is enabled on this network. Defaults to true.
- `dhcp_lease` (Number) The DHCP lease time in seconds. Defaults to 86400 (24 hours).
- `dhcp_start` (String) The start of the DHCP IP range.
- `dhcp_stop` (String) The end of the DHCP IP range.
- `domain_name` (String) The domain name for this network.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the network is enabled. Defaults to true.
- `igmp_snooping` (Boolean) Whether IGMP snooping is enabled. Defaults to false.
- `network_group` (String) The network group. Defaults to 'LAN'.
- `subnet` (String) The subnet in CIDR notation (e.g., '10.0.100.0/24').
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `vlan_id` (Number) The VLAN ID for this network. Must be between 1 and 4095.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the network.
- `site_id` (String) The site ID where the network is created.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
