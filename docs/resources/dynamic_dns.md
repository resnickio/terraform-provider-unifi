# unifi_dynamic_dns (Resource)

Manages a UniFi dynamic DNS (DDNS) configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# DuckDNS configuration
resource "unifi_dynamic_dns" "duckdns" {
  service  = "duckdns"
  hostname = "mynetwork.duckdns.org"
  password = "your-duckdns-token"
}

# Cloudflare configuration
resource "unifi_dynamic_dns" "cloudflare" {
  service  = "cloudflare"
  hostname = "home.example.com"
  login    = "email@example.com"
  password = "cloudflare-api-token"
}

# No-IP configuration
resource "unifi_dynamic_dns" "noip" {
  service  = "noip"
  hostname = "myhost.no-ip.org"
  login    = "username"
  password = "password"
}

# Custom DDNS provider
resource "unifi_dynamic_dns" "custom" {
  service  = "custom"
  hostname = "home.example.com"
  server   = "update.example.com"
  login    = "username"
  password = "password"
  options  = "myip=<ip>&hostname=<h>"
}

# Using WAN2 interface
resource "unifi_dynamic_dns" "wan2" {
  service   = "dyndns"
  hostname  = "backup.example.com"
  login     = "username"
  password  = "password"
  interface = "wan2"
}
```

### Optional

- `interface` (String) The WAN interface to monitor for IP changes. Valid values: wan, wan2. Defaults to wan.
- `login` (String) The login/username for the dynamic DNS service.
- `options` (String) Additional options for the dynamic DNS service.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password or API token for the dynamic DNS service. Note: This value is write-only and cannot be read back from the controller.
- `server` (String) The server address for the dynamic DNS service (primarily used with 'custom' service).
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the dynamic DNS configuration.
- `site_id` (String) The site ID where the dynamic DNS is configured.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
