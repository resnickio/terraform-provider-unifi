# unifi_user_group (Resource)

Manages a UniFi user group (bandwidth profile). User groups define bandwidth limits for clients.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a bandwidth-limited user group for guests
resource "unifi_user_group" "guest_limited" {
  name             = "Guest Limited"
  qos_rate_max_down = 10000  # 10 Mbps download
  qos_rate_max_up   = 5000   # 5 Mbps upload
}

# Create an unlimited user group
resource "unifi_user_group" "unlimited" {
  name             = "Unlimited"
  qos_rate_max_down = -1  # Unlimited
  qos_rate_max_up   = -1  # Unlimited
}

# Create a heavily throttled IoT group
resource "unifi_user_group" "iot_throttled" {
  name             = "IoT Throttled"
  qos_rate_max_down = 1000  # 1 Mbps download
  qos_rate_max_up   = 500   # 500 Kbps upload
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the user group.

### Optional

- `qos_rate_max_down` (Number) Maximum download rate in kbps. Set to -1 for unlimited.
- `qos_rate_max_up` (Number) Maximum upload rate in kbps. Set to -1 for unlimited.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the user group.
- `site_id` (String) The site ID where the user group is created.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
