# unifi_firewall_group (Resource)

Manages a UniFi firewall group (IP address group, port group, or IPv6 address group).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an address group for IoT devices
resource "unifi_firewall_group" "iot_devices" {
  name       = "IoT Devices"
  group_type = "address-group"
  members = [
    "10.0.100.10",
    "10.0.100.11",
    "10.0.100.0/24",
  ]
}

# Create a port group for common web ports
resource "unifi_firewall_group" "web_ports" {
  name       = "Web Ports"
  group_type = "port-group"
  members    = ["80", "443", "8080-8090"]
}

# Create an IPv6 address group
resource "unifi_firewall_group" "ipv6_servers" {
  name       = "IPv6 Servers"
  group_type = "ipv6-address-group"
  members = [
    "2001:db8::1",
    "2001:db8::/32",
  ]
}

## Schema

### Required

- `group_type` (String) The type of the firewall group. Valid values are: 'address-group' (IPv4 addresses/CIDRs), 'port-group' (port numbers/ranges), 'ipv6-address-group' (IPv6 addresses/CIDRs).
- `members` (Set of String) The members of the firewall group. For address groups, this is a set of IP addresses or CIDR ranges. For port groups, this is a set of port numbers or ranges (e.g., '80', '8080-8090').
- `name` (String) The name of the firewall group.

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the firewall group.
- `site_id` (String) The site ID where the firewall group is created.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
