# unifi_radius_profile (Resource)

Manages a UniFi RADIUS profile for 802.1X authentication on wireless and wired networks.

## Example Usage

### Basic RADIUS Profile

```hcl
resource "unifi_radius_profile" "basic" {
  name = "Corporate RADIUS"
}
```

### Full RADIUS Profile with Auth and Accounting Servers

```hcl
resource "unifi_radius_profile" "full" {
  name = "Enterprise RADIUS"

  use_usg_auth_server = false
  use_usg_acct_server = false

  vlan_enabled   = true
  vlan_wlan_mode = "optional"

  interim_update_enabled  = true
  interim_update_interval = 600

  auth_server {
    ip     = "10.0.0.100"
    port   = 1812
    secret = "auth-secret-here"
  }

  acct_server {
    ip     = "10.0.0.100"
    port   = 1813
    secret = "acct-secret-here"
  }
}
```

### RADIUS Profile with Multiple Servers for Redundancy

```hcl
resource "unifi_radius_profile" "redundant" {
  name = "Redundant RADIUS"

  auth_server {
    ip     = "10.0.0.100"
    port   = 1812
    secret = "primary-secret"
  }

  auth_server {
    ip     = "10.0.0.101"
    port   = 1812
    secret = "secondary-secret"
  }
}
```

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.

## Import

RADIUS profiles can be imported using the ID:

```shell
terraform import unifi_radius_profile.example 60a1b2c3d4e5f67890123456
```

~> **Note:** The `secret` attribute for auth and accounting servers will not be imported as it is write-only in the UniFi API.
