# unifi_static_dns (Resource)

Manages a UniFi static DNS record.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic A record
resource "unifi_static_dns" "server" {
  key         = "server.internal.example.com"
  value       = "192.168.1.100"
  record_type = "A"
}

# A record with TTL
resource "unifi_static_dns" "db" {
  key         = "db.internal.example.com"
  value       = "192.168.1.101"
  record_type = "A"
  ttl         = 300
}

# CNAME record
resource "unifi_static_dns" "alias" {
  key         = "api.internal.example.com"
  value       = "server.internal.example.com"
  record_type = "CNAME"
}

# MX record with priority
resource "unifi_static_dns" "mail" {
  key         = "example.com"
  value       = "mail.example.com"
  record_type = "MX"
  priority    = 10
}

# SRV record
resource "unifi_static_dns" "sip" {
  key         = "_sip._tcp.example.com"
  value       = "sipserver.example.com"
  record_type = "SRV"
  port        = 5060
  priority    = 10
  weight      = 5
}

# Disabled record
resource "unifi_static_dns" "legacy" {
  key         = "oldserver.internal.example.com"
  value       = "192.168.1.50"
  record_type = "A"
  enabled     = false
}

## Schema

### Required

- `key` (String) The hostname or domain name for the DNS record.
- `record_type` (String) The DNS record type. Valid values: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, SRV.
- `value` (String) The value for the DNS record (IP address, hostname, or other value depending on record type).

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the DNS record is enabled. Defaults to true.
- `port` (Number) Port number for SRV records. Must be between 1 and 65535.
- `priority` (Number) Priority value for MX and SRV records.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `ttl` (Number) Time to live in seconds for the DNS record.
- `weight` (Number) Weight value for SRV records.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the static DNS record.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
