## Example Usage

### Lookup by Name

```hcl
data "unifi_traffic_route" "vpn_route" {
  name = "VPN Traffic Route"
}

output "route_enabled" {
  value = data.unifi_traffic_route.vpn_route.enabled
}
```

### Lookup by ID

```hcl
data "unifi_traffic_route" "by_id" {
  id = "60a1b2c3d4e5f67890123456"
}
```
